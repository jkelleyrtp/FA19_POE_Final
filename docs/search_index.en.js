additional component added more complexity and points of failure. To mitigate the potential non-obvious potholes, we decided to start designing the system from a high-level first before diving into the details. \nOur mechanical system had a handful of requirements:\n\nThe ability to \"throw a punch\"\nThe ability to \"bob and weave\"\nThe ability to \"block a punch\"\n\nThis ultimately manifested itself into a robot with:\n\nTwo arms\n3 DoF per arm (shoulder, proximal, and distal)\n2 DoF hip system\n\nUsing OnShape as our CAD software of choice, we sketched out the high-level geometry, making sure to maintain realistic dimensions and leave room for important components like servos, motors, and sensors.

This was an exceptionally ambitious Principles of Engineering project and required advanced skills in CAD, CAM, math, firmware, software, and systems integration. Each component of the system -  whether it be the serial output format of the robot joints or the location of the elbow linkage - was dependent on the other components. This led to an incredibly carefully designed collection of components that pushed the limits of Olin's 3D printers, the STM32 microcontroller, and the compute power of the school laptops. \n\n    \n\n🔗Final Feature Set\nThe final featureset of the Real Steel shadow-boxing robot is quite amazing:\n\n8 Degrees of freedom - two arms and a hip system\nThe ability to bob, weave, throw punches, and dab, all in real time\n8 real-time PID controllers maintaining closed-loop control of the robot joint positions\nReal time pose estimation using a Time-of-Flight depth sensor\nReal-time kinematic solving of a 3 DoF robotic arm from a human's 7 DoF\nA portable Python-based multithreaded framework for data collection, processing, visualization, and serial output\nPre-programmed positions for control without the kinect\n\n🔗Challenges and Constraints\nWe ran into several challenges while designing and building the Real Steel robot. These included:\n\nLimited microcontroller inputs 12 quadrature encoders (2 robots worth, ran out after 1 robot)\nLimited outputs to control all the motor outputs\nLimited electrical power to power all motors simultaneously\nLimited compute power to process the kinect data and convert it into a serial packet with joint information\nLimited mechanical strength on 3D printed parts to handle the forces involved in moving the robot around\n\nThe following sections address these challenges and provide further insights on how the final feature set came together.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/overview/","title":"Overview"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/systems-design/":{"body":"The systems-design of the Real Steel robots is incredible.

We interface with the Kinect using the OpenNI2 library for core Kinect features and NiTE2 for skeleton tracking purposes. To support the Kinect v1 camera with these two libraries, the OpenNI2-FreenectDriver bridge must also be installed. These libraries allow us to develop in non-windows platforms using opensource software.\n🔗Dependency Installation\nThere are difficulties in getting these dependencies installed as the OpenNI and NiTE project was discontinued when Apple bought PrimeSense. Instead, these packages are now hosted and can be downloaded using the following guide:\nhttps://github.com/roboticslab-uc3m/installation-guides/blob/master/install-openni-nite.md\n🔗Skeleton Tracking\nUsing NiTE2 we access skeleton tracking information from the Kinect. At each frame we obtain the position of all 15 joints as (x, y, z) coordinates. \n\n    \n\n🔗Coordinate System\nThe Kinect and OpenNI has two coordinate systems used. These two systems are referred to as Depth and World representation. The differences can be described like so:\n\nDepth coordinates\n\nthe native data representation\nthe origin is the top-left corner of the field of view\nx and y coordinates are reference to the image frame pixels\nthe depth value represents the distance between the camera plane and whatever object is in the given pixel\n\n\nWorld coordinates\n\nsuperimpose a more familiar 3D Cartesian coordinate system on the world\nthe origin is at the Kinect camera lens\nevery point is specified by 3 points (x, y , z) in millimeters\n\n\n\n\n    \n\nWe obtain the joint information and can convert between both systems depending on our needs.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/human-tracking/","title":"Human Tracking"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/inverse-kinematics/":{"body":"Inverse Kinematics is needed to map human movement into robot movement. This is because, calculating joint angles using human extracted joints doesn't translate to robot joint angles. We have different joints than the robot and at different positions and lengths. Instead, using an inverse kinematics solver an articulated body can be programmed to reach a certain target position with its end effector.\n\n\n\nIn RealSteel's robots, we have the following revolute joints in an arm:\n\nShoulder\nProximal\nDistal\n\n\n    \n\n🔗How Does It Work?\nGiven a target position, how can we position the articulated body and all it's joints such that the end effector reaches the target? An inverse kinematics solver answers this question with two categories of solutions:\n\nAnalytic solutions\nApproximating solutions\n\nWe use ikpy, an inverse kinematics library, that can quickly approximate the solution with an iterative optimizer with regularization for smoothing.\n\n    \n\nikpy also can import the kinematic chain to solve as long as the robot is defined in URDF format. Luckily for us, we designed our own robot in OnShape and using onshape-to-robot we can convert our OnShape assembly to URDF robot definition.\n🔗ikpy Coordinate System\nikpy defines its kinematic chain to start at the origin in a coordinate system that is rotated 90° about the x-axis compared to the Kinect coordinate system. We also run into an issue as the Kinect tracks joint positions with respect to a fixed origin at the center of it's camera lens and not at the base of the kinematic chain - the origin that ikpy expects. Therefore, any target position that we want to solve for with ikpy will be misinterpreted.\nThe solution is to transform the target joint's (the hand joint) position from the Kinect frame to a frame that has it's origin fixed at the shoulder joint of the arm that is being solved for. The z or depth value is then inverted to place depth in front of the person, and the point is rotated 90° about the x-axis. This way now the kinematic chain and target joint position are in the same frame of reference, and ikpy can solve correctly.\n\n    \n\n🔗The Process\nWith all the tools in place, we can now proceed with solving for our robot joint angles in real-time in the following steps (note: this is done independently for both arms each)\n\nObtain robot model in URDF format\nImport model into ikpy and define a base_element to start the kinematic chain at the shoulder joint of an arm\nObtain target position from the Kinect → the world coordinates for skeletal joint at the hand for the corresponding arm\nPerform the necessary transforms to get the target into ikpy coordinate system\nSolve for joint angles\n\nhttps://youtu.be/kSUGiyJ5UbY\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/inverse-kinematics/","title":"Inverse Kinematics"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/multithreading/":{"body":"🔗Multithreaded Framework\nIn order to perform the skeleton tracking, joint solving, visualizations, and communication all together  simultaneously, we set up a multithreaded framework centered around python's multiprocessing Queues. In our framework, we use two queues: an input queue and a device/output queue. \nThe input queue gets Kinect joint information pushed into it at every frame. The other systems, inverse kinematics and visualizations, pop joint information off of this queue as long as it's not empty for processing.\nThe device queue gets robot joint angles pushed into it at every iteration of the main robot loop and communicates these angles over serial whenever they are available.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/multithreading/","title":"Multithreaded Framework"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/pybullet/":{"body":"Before we send the joint coordinates over serial to the actual robot, we want to ensure that our methodology and solutions are correct.

We set up the serial interface in a separate thread as to not slow down the main thread responsible for moving data in between each of the system components. This let us maintain a 1 kHz control loop between the master computer and Real Steel robot without any performance impact on the rest of the software system.\nTo communicate, we used the bson minified data format - a compressed version of csv with a fixed schema based on packet length. We also developed a custom interpreter for the STM32 as there were no obvious choices that fit on an embedded system to interpret the serial data. The final format for commands between the computer and robot followed as such:\n\n\t#[derive(debug, fmt)]\n\tenum MessageTypes {\n\t\tsetpoint(RobotSetpoint)\n\t}\n\n\timpl serialize for MessageTypes {\n\t\tfn serialize() -&gt; String {\n\t\t\tmatch Self {\n\t\t\t\tMessageTypes::setpoint(setpoint) -&gt; {\n\t\t\t\t\treturn format!(\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\"0\",\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.left_shoulder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.left_proximal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.left_distal: usize,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.right_shoulder,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.right_proximal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tsetpoint.right_distal,\n\t\t\t\t\t\tpitch: usize,\n\t\t\t\t\t\troll: uszie\n\t\t\t\t\t)\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t#[derive(debug, fmt)]\n\tstruct RobotSetpoint {\n\t\tleft_shoulder: usize,\n\t\tleft_proximal: usize,\n\t\tleft_distal: usize,\n\t\tright_shoulder: usize,\n\t\tright_proximal: usize,\n\t\tright_distal: usize,\n\t\tpitch: usize,\n\t\troll: uszie\n\t}\n\nWith this format, we could easily serialize and deserialize robot setpoints from the kinematic solver and convert them into a message that the robot could interpret. Messages could be of variable length, with the expected length determined by the leading digit for the packet. As shown above, the leading digit for the RobotSetpoint is 0 - so the stm32 can easily decode the robot position over a simple serial packet.\n","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/serial-output/","title":"Serial Output"},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/systems-overview/":{"body":"","id":"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/systems-overview/","title":"Software Overview"}},"docInfo":{"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/ece/control-loops-and-feedback/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/ece/firmwareoverview/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/ece/sensors/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/hardware/arm/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/hardware/assembly/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/hardware/base/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/hardware/high-level-design/":{"body":91,"title":3},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/hardware/torso/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/brainstorming/":{"body":116,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/budget/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/overview/":{"body":205,"title":1},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/overview/systems-design/":{"body":16,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/human-tracking/":{"body":163,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/inverse-kinematics/":{"body":256,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/multithreading/":{"body":66,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/pybullet/":{"body":37,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/references/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/serial-output/":{"body":169,"title":2},"https://www.getzola.org/documentation/software/systems-overview/":{"body":0,"title":2}},"length":19}};
