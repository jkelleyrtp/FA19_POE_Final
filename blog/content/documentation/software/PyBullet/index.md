Before we send the joint coordinates over serial to the actual robot, we want to ensure that our methodology and solutions are correct. Therefore, we use PyBullet, a physics engine, to simulate our robot movements.

Loading in our URDF file for the robot, we can pump in the joint angles and see how a virtual replica of our robot would behave under proper physics.
