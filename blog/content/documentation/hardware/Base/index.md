The base of the robot underwent significant development. Early revisions were severely underspecced and not strong enough to hold the weight of the entire bot. 

The final design included 2 degrees of freedom - one for side-to-side movements and one for forward-to-backward movements - essentially pitch and roll. The dual fourbar design allowed the robot to move in both directions at once with design inspiration from joysticks. We used potentiometers to get feedback from the fourbars and a interesting method of embedded shaft to strength the prints.
